// LATER TODO: GAMEOVER WITH COLLISION WITH VEHICLE

// LATER LATER TODO: add clock for time remaining to deliver the packages


// VERY LATE TODO: add logic for how to collect and deliver packages (waiting 2 sec near the front door of the house)

// you can collect 1 package, then to deliver it to other house or put it in your courier house
// +30 sec every time you deliver a package or put it in your courier house
// start with 3 min (180 sec) timer
// packages randomly will spawn in front of houses (3 packages at a time)
// no clues where the packages are, you have to find them, no minimap

// vehicle hit = game over (run over) or time up = game over

// 1 package delivered = +10 score
// score is shown in the main game screen left up corner, time on right up corner like a digital rect clock

// TO FIX: buildings positions + to fulfill the map

// OPTIONAL: maybe add 1 dog that chases u when u are in certain area - maybe near the church right side 
// (dog catch u - 20 points and - 20 sec as penalty)
